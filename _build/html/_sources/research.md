1. Regularization to guarantee the approximation guarantee of eigenfunctions (L1, Sobolev, Physics-informed). See maybe "Convergence and error analysis of PINNs"
2. Leverage the methods used for ergodic systems to general systems
3. Online learning of eigenfunctions
4. Conformal prediction for online learning of eigenfunction in nomn stationary context (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.13415)
5. Sequential Monte-Carlo
6. Study of convergence with the signature
7. Gradient flow of SGD
8. Compactification of koopman operator for open state space
9. Implicit neural representation for modeling eigenfunctions
